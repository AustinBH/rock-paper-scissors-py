# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple CLI game of rock paper scissors played between a user and a computer.

Each version is supposed to give an opportunity to use a different design structure.

## Versions
    * Version 1
        - This version is all written out and plays a first to 5 match.
    * Version 2
        - This version will play until the user quits the game with q or quit.
    * Version 3
        - This version plays the same way as version 2. However, rather than writing out each of the actions inside of one while loop, I used functions to act out each section of the game.
